Unveiling the Power of Data-Driven Fault Detection in HVAC Systems: A Journey Through Advanced Machine Learning

As we increasingly rely on technology to optimize energy efficiency and maintain comfort in modern buildings, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems stand at the forefront of this revolution. HVAC systems play a pivotal role in ensuring indoor air quality, comfort, and energy efficiency in buildings. However, undetected faults in these systems can lead to increased energy consumption, suboptimal performance, and expensive maintenance. Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) is an essential aspect of modern building management, helping facility operators detect and rectify anomalies before they escalate into significant issues.

In this post, we explore a data-driven approach to FDD in multi-zone Variable Air Volume (VAV) Air Handling Units (AHUs) using a publicly available dataset provided by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
